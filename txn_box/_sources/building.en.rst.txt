Building
***************

|TxB| building is based on `SCons <https://scons.org>`__ and `Parts
<https://pypi.org/project/scons-parts/>`__. As a plugin, |TxB| also requires an instance of `Traffic
Server <https://trafficserver.apache.org>`__, or at least the plugin API header files.

Other dependencies

*  `pcre2 <https://www.pcre.org>`__

   Generally ``sudo dnf install pcre2-devel`` or ``sudo yum install pcre2-devel``.

*  Scons/Parts::

      python3 -m pip install --user scons-parts

   It is important to use `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/>`__ - no attempt
   has been made for Python 2 compabitility. It may be necessary to edit the "scons" script for this
   reason. This should be "~/.local/bin/scons". If scons or parts doesn't seem to be found, make
   sure the first line in that file has "python3" and not just "python".

To build the plugin, first build and install Traffic Server. Then use the command ::

   scons txn_box --with-trafficserver=<ts_path>

where ``<ts_path>`` is the path to a Traffic Server install. In general this wil be the same
path as used for the ``prefix`` configuration option in Traffic Server.
